Description:
Contains com.google.common.util.concurrent.internal.InternalFutureFailureAccess and InternalFutures. Most users will never need to use this artifact. Its classes are conceptually a part of Guava, but they're in this separate artifact so that Android libraries can use them without pulling in all of Guava (just as they can use ListenableFuture by depending on the listenablefuture artifact).

Local Modifications:
No modifications.
